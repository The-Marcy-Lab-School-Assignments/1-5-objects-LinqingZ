# Question
Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{
  name: "Zo",
  isCool: true,
  age: 28
}
```

# Answer
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. The example didn't put the key to be in string. In JSON, property names must be enclosed in double quotes.
